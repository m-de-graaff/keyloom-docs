# Why Keyloom Outperforms the Competition

The authentication landscape is crowded with solutions that either oversimplify or overcomplicate. Keyloom delivers enterprise-grade security with exceptional developer experience, while keeping you in complete control of your data and costs.

## The Authentication Problem in 2025

Most authentication solutions force you to choose between:
- **Simple but limited** libraries that require extensive custom work for enterprise features
- **Powerful but expensive** hosted services that create vendor lock-in and unpredictable costs
- **Complex enterprise** solutions that require dedicated DevOps teams

**Keyloom solves this by providing enterprise features with library simplicity, at zero ongoing cost.**

<Callout type="info">
**The Bottom Line**: Keyloom gives you Auth0-level features at NextAuth.js complexity, with complete data ownership and predictable costs.
</Callout>

## Detailed Comparisons

### Keyloom vs NextAuth.js (Auth.js)

**NextAuth.js** is the most popular authentication library for Next.js, but it's showing its age.

| Feature | Keyloom | NextAuth.js |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **TypeScript Support** | **100% type-safe** - Every function, every return type | Good, but type gaps in adapters & providers |
| **Security Architecture** | **Security-first design** - CSRF, rate limiting, PKCE built-in | Security features require manual setup |
| **Edge Runtime** | **Full edge compatibility** - Works everywhere | **Major limitation** - Limited edge support |
| **Database Adapters** | **Contract-tested consistency** - Same API across all DBs | Adapter quality varies, inconsistent APIs |
| **RBAC & Multi-tenancy** | **Built-in organizations, roles, permissions** | **Major gap** - Requires extensive custom code |
| **Session Management** | **Hybrid strategy** - JWT + Database benefits | Either/or choice, no hybrid option |
| **CLI & DevEx** | **Full CLI suite** - init, migrate, doctor, routes | **No tooling** - Manual setup only |
| **Bundle Size** | **Tree-shakeable** - Import only what you need | Large bundle, everything included |
| **Maintenance** | **Active development** - Modern architecture | Legacy codebase, slower innovation |

**Why Keyloom wins:**
- **Enterprise-ready out of the box** - RBAC, audit logs, multi-tenancy included
- **Modern architecture** - Built for edge, TypeScript-first, security-focused
- **Better developer experience** - CLI tools, consistent APIs, complete type safety
- **Future-proof** - Designed for modern deployment patterns

**When to stick with NextAuth.js:**
- You have an existing NextAuth.js implementation that works
- You need the absolute largest ecosystem (though Keyloom's is growing fast)
- You prefer the most battle-tested option (though Keyloom is production-ready)

## What Makes Keyloom Unique

### Zero Cost, Maximum Value

**The only enterprise-grade auth solution that's completely free:**

```bash
# Total cost for unlimited users, forever
$ echo "Keyloom cost calculation:"
$ echo "Base cost: $0"
$ echo "Per-user cost: $0"
$ echo "Enterprise features: $0"
$ echo "Total: $0"
```

**Compare this to competitors:**
- **Auth0**: $30,780/year for 100k users
- **Clerk**: $30,000/year for 50k users
- **Firebase**: $66,000/year for 1M authentications
- **Keyloom**: $0/year for unlimited users

### Security That Actually Works

**Built-in security features that competitors charge extra for:**

```typescript
// CSRF protection - built-in, not an add-on
import { validateDoubleSubmit } from "@keyloom/core/guard/csrf";

// Rate limiting - included, not extra
import { rateLimit } from "@keyloom/core/guard/rate-limit";

// PKCE for OAuth - standard, not premium
import { generatePKCE } from "@keyloom/core/oauth/pkce";

// Argon2id password hashing - secure by default
import { hash } from "@keyloom/core/crypto/argon2id";
```

### TypeScript Excellence

**100% type-safe authentication - no runtime surprises:**

```typescript
// Every function is fully typed
import type { Session, User, LoginResult } from "@keyloom/core";

// IntelliSense works perfectly
const result: LoginResult = await login({
  email: "user@example.com", // ✅ Type-checked
  password: "secure123",     // ✅ Type-checked
  ttlMinutes: 60            // ✅ Optional, type-checked
});

// No casting, no 'any' types, no runtime errors
const { user, session } = result; // ✅ Fully typed
```

### Modern Architecture

**Built for 2025+ deployment patterns:**

```typescript
// Tree-shakeable imports - only bundle what you use
import { login } from "@keyloom/core/runtime/login";
import { validateCSRF } from "@keyloom/core/guard/csrf";

// Edge runtime compatible - deploy anywhere
export const runtime = 'edge'; // ✅ Works perfectly

// Hybrid session strategy - best of both worlds
const config = {
  session: {
    strategy: 'hybrid', // JWT + Database benefits
    rolling: true,      // Automatic token refresh
    secure: true        // Production-ready defaults
  }
};
```

### Developer Experience That Doesn't Suck

**CLI tools that actually help:**

```bash
# Set up a complete auth system in 2 minutes
keyloom init

# Generate type-safe database schemas
keyloom migrate

# Health check everything
keyloom doctor

# Generate route protection
keyloom routes

# Add UI components
keyloom ui add signin
```

### Enterprise Features Without Enterprise Pricing

**RBAC, audit logging, and multi-tenancy included:**

```typescript
// Organizations and roles - built-in
const membership = await createMembership({
  userId: user.id,
  orgId: organization.id,
  role: 'admin'
});

// Audit logging - included
await audit('user.login', {
  userId: user.id,
  ip: request.ip,
  userAgent: request.headers['user-agent']
});

// Multi-tenancy - ready to go
const userOrgs = await getUserOrganizations(user.id);
```
