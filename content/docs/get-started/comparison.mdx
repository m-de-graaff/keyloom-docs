# Why Keyloom Outperforms the Competition

The authentication landscape is crowded with solutions that either oversimplify or overcomplicate. Keyloom delivers enterprise-grade security with exceptional developer experience, while keeping you in complete control of your data and costs.

## The Authentication Problem in 2024

Most authentication solutions force you to choose between:
- **Simple but limited** libraries that require extensive custom work for enterprise features
- **Powerful but expensive** hosted services that create vendor lock-in and unpredictable costs
- **Complex enterprise** solutions that require dedicated DevOps teams

**Keyloom solves this by providing enterprise features with library simplicity, at zero ongoing cost.**

<Callout type="info">
**The Bottom Line**: Keyloom gives you Auth0-level features at NextAuth.js complexity, with complete data ownership and predictable costs.

## Detailed Comparisons

### 🆚 Keyloom vs NextAuth.js (Auth.js)

**NextAuth.js** is the most popular authentication library for Next.js, but it's showing its age.

| Feature | Keyloom | NextAuth.js |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **TypeScript Support** | ✅ **100% type-safe** - Every function, every return type | ⚠️ Good, but type gaps in adapters & providers |
| **Security Architecture** | ✅ **Security-first design** - CSRF, rate limiting, PKCE built-in | ⚠️ Security features require manual setup |
| **Edge Runtime** | ✅ **Full edge compatibility** - Works everywhere | ❌ **Major limitation** - Limited edge support |
| **Database Adapters** | ✅ **Contract-tested consistency** - Same API across all DBs | ⚠️ Adapter quality varies, inconsistent APIs |
| **RBAC & Multi-tenancy** | ✅ **Built-in organizations, roles, permissions** | ❌ **Major gap** - Requires extensive custom code |
| **Session Management** | ✅ **Hybrid strategy** - JWT + Database benefits | ⚠️ Either/or choice, no hybrid option |
| **CLI & DevEx** | ✅ **Full CLI suite** - init, migrate, doctor, routes | ❌ **No tooling** - Manual setup only |
| **Bundle Size** | ✅ **Tree-shakeable** - Import only what you need | ❌ Large bundle, everything included |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ **Active development** - Modern architecture | ⚠️ Legacy codebase, slower innovation |

**💡 Why Keyloom wins:**

  cookieToken: request.cookies.get('csrf-token'),
  headerToken: request.headers.get('x-csrf-token')
});
```

### 🎯 **TypeScript Excellence**

Complete type safety across all operations:

```typescript
// Example: Fully typed session and user objects
import type { Session, User } from "@keyloom/core";

const { session, user }: { 
  session: Session | null, 
  user: User | null 
} = await getCurrentSession(cookieValue, adapter);
```

### 🏗️ **Modular Architecture**

Use only what you need with tree-shaking support:

```typescript
// Import only specific functions
import { login } from "@keyloom/core/runtime/login";
import { validateDoubleSubmit } from "@keyloom/core/guard/csrf";
import { tokenHash } from "@keyloom/core/crypto/token-hash";
```
