Keyloom supports email-centric flows: verify email, forgot password, password reset confirmations, and 2FA recovery notifications.

## Delivery

You can integrate any mailer (SMTP provider, API-based services). Keyloom calls your email-sending function with the required tokens and templates. Keep delivery side-effects idempotent.

## Common flows

- Verify email: send verification link with time-limited token
- Forgot password: send reset link with time-limited token
- Reset confirmation: optional confirmation to user

## Security

- Use short-lived, single-use tokens
- Avoid leaking whether an email exists; respond with generic success
- Sign links with your `AUTH_SECRET` indirectly via server-generated tokens

## Local testing

- Use "development inbox" tools (e.g., MailHog, Mailpit, Resend test mode)
- Log emails to console in dev to unblock UI iteration
