title: Users & Accounts
---

Users represent identities in your application. Accounts link external providers to users.

## Users

- Local credentials (email/password) or OAuth-only identities
- Profile fields: email (unique), name, image, and any domain-specific attributes
- Email verification state is tracked and enforced during sign-in

## Accounts

- One user can have many accounts (e.g., GitHub + Google)
- Stores provider id, provider account id, and tokens where necessary
- Account linking occurs on successful OAuth callback based on provider identifiers

## Deletion & GDPR

- Deleting a user should remove or anonymize linked accounts and sessions
- Prefer cascading deletes at the DB level to keep referential integrity

## Admin & roles

Role/permission metadata can live on the user record or in a join table. See Tutorials for role-based route protection patterns.
