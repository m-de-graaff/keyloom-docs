title: CLI
---

Keyloom includes a batteries-included CLI for scaffolding, validation, and maintenance.

## Commands

- init — create minimal config and environment hints
- scaffold — generate pages (App/Pages Router)
- routes — generate a routes manifest (used by middleware/guards)
- doctor — run environment and wiring checks; can auto-fix common issues

## Scaffold

Generate auth pages quickly. Supports individual pages or presets.

```
keyloom scaffold login register
keyloom scaffold --router app register
keyloom scaffold --all
```

## Doctor

Validate your setup.

```
keyloom doctor            # report only
keyloom doctor --fix      # propose fixes (interactive)
keyloom doctor --fix --yes# apply fixes without prompts
```

What it checks: `AUTH_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, middleware, routes manifest, cookie policy, base URL, and more.

## Routes manifest

```
keyloom routes --out .keyloom/routes.generated.ts
```

Generate a typed manifest for guards/middleware. Keep it under source control to aid local/dev builds.
