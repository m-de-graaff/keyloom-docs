Keyloom is TypeScript-first: all public APIs, events, and config objects are typed.

## Config typing

Your `keyloom.config.ts` is fully typed; IDEs provide autocompletion for adapter options, providers, hooks, and cookie settings.

## Domain models

Types cover `User`, `Account`, `Session`, verification tokens, and 2FA artifacts. Extend via declaration merging or configuration generics when available.

## Safer handlers

Route handlers and middleware expose typed helpers, reducing footguns around CSRF, cookie parsing, and header inspection.

## DX tips

- Enable `strict` mode
- Use `@types/node` version matching your runtime
- Keep Prisma types up-to-date (`prisma generate`) when changing your schema
