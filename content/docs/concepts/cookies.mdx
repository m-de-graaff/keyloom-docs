title: Cookies

Keyloom uses secure, HTTP-only cookies for sessions and CSRF. Defaults are designed for production.

## Session cookie

- HTTP-only, Secure (in production), SameSite=Lax by default
- Contains an opaque session identifier (DB strategy) or signed payload (JWT strategy)
- Path-scoped to your application; respect Next.js domain configuration

## CSRF cookie

- Binds CSRF token to the browser context
- Rotated and validated by server on state-changing requests

## Configuration

Most apps do not need to customize cookie names or flags. If you do, configure them in `keyloom.config.ts`. Keep `Secure=true` and `SameSite=Lax/Strict` in production; only relax for known cross-site flows.

## Local development

- Use `http://localhost` with `Secure=false` automatically handled by dev tooling
- Avoid mixing `localhost` and custom hosts to prevent cookie domain confusion
