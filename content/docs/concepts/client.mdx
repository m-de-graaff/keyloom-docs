Client-side usage centers on simple UI components and thin helpers that talk to the API handler.

## UI Components

From `@keyloom/ui` you can render production-ready forms:

- Login form
- Registration form
- Forgot / Reset password
- Email verification
- 2FA setup and challenge

They handle form state, validation, CSRF, and success/error rendering. Wire them to your routes as shown in Tutorials.

## Getting the session

Use the appropriate approach for your router:

- App Router (Server Components): fetch on the server and pass down as props
- Client Components: call a lightweight `/api/auth/session` endpoint or use your preferred data layer

## Route protection

Prefer middleware for coarse-grained protection and server-side guards for fine-grained checks (e.g., role-based sections). See Concepts: Sessions and Tutorials for patterns.
