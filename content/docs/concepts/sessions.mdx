title: Sessions
---

Keyloom supports database and JWT session strategies with a unified API.

## Strategies

- Database: stores opaque session id + metadata in the DB. Cookie contains only the id.
- JWT: stores a signed, tamper-evident payload in the cookie. No DB lookups for reads.

Choose DB for centralized revocation and longer sessions; choose JWT for edge performance and stateless scale.

## Issuance & rotation

Sessions are issued after successful auth (password or OAuth). Rotation occurs on sensitive events. Both strategies respect cookie best practices.

## Accessing the session

- Server: read via the Keyloom server helpers in your route/middleware
- Client: fetch minimal session info from an endpoint you control

## Invalidating sessions

- Database: delete the row(s) by user or session id
- JWT: rotate secrets or maintain a denylist at edge for targeted revocation
