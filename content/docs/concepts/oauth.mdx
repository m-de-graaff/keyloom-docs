Keyloom integrates OAuth providers while keeping your app in control.

## Providers

Configure providers in `keyloom.config.ts` with client id/secret environment variables. Each provider contributes its authorization URL, scopes, and profile mapping.

## Flow

- User is redirected to provider's authorization page
- Provider redirects back to your app's callback (handled by the Keyloom API route)
- Keyloom verifies state/nonce, exchanges code for tokens, and links/creates an Account for the User
- A session is issued

## Accounts

The `Account` table links external provider identities to your local `User`. Multiple accounts can point to a single user (account linking).

## Security

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Rotate client secrets and restrict redirect URLs
- Use least-privilege scopes; store only necessary profile data
