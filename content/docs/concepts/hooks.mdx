title: Hooks

Hook points let you react to lifecycle events and extend behavior.

## Examples of hook moments

- Before/after sign-in
- Before/after sign-out
- After user created / email verified
- Before issuing a session

Register hook handlers in your Keyloom config or via a plugin. Handlers run on the server and receive typed payloads (user, request context, outcome). Keep them fast and side-effect safe; use background jobs for slow work.
