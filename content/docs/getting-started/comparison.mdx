# Comparison

> “Comparison is the thief of joy.” — but picking the right tool still matters.

Here are non‑detailed reasons why you may want to use Keyloom over other auth libraries and services.

## vs Other Auth Libraries

- Framework‑agnostic core
  - Works with any TypeScript runtime; add first‑class Next.js integration only when you need it.
- Advanced features built‑in
  - Sessions (database or JWT), RBAC, route‑level visibility, CSRF safeguards, secure cookie defaults.
- Pluggable architecture
  - Adapters for your database layer (Prisma, Drizzle, SQL/NoSQL) and extensible OAuth providers.
- Full control
  - No hidden magic. Configure flows in `keyloom.config.ts`; test with small, composable modules.

## vs Self‑Hosted Auth Servers

- No separate infrastructure
  - Runs in your app—no dedicated auth service to deploy or scale.
- Zero server maintenance
  - Avoid provisioning, patching, and monitoring additional services.
- Complete feature set
  - Everything you need for modern auth without the operational overhead.

## vs Managed Auth Services

- Keep your data
  - Users remain in your database and under your compliance boundary.
- Predictable costs
  - No per‑user pricing; scale with your existing stack.
- Single source of truth
  - User and session data stay next to your application data.

## vs Rolling Your Own

- Security handled
  - Sensible defaults and battle‑tested flows so you don’t reinvent risky parts.
- Focus on your product
  - Ship features faster; avoid yak‑shaving auth edge cases.
- Extensible by design
  - Add custom behavior via adapters/providers instead of forking or deep patches.
