## Overview

| Solution | Model & Pricing | Hosting | Features (highlights) | Developer Experience | Typical Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keyloom | Open-source library; self-hosted. No per-MAU fees. | Your infra (Next.js, Node) | Sessions (DB/JWT), CSRF, RBAC, OAuth, email flows, 2FA; Prisma-first | TypeScript-first; CLI, UI components; flexible | Startups/teams needing full control and no per-MAU SaaS costs |
| NextAuth.js | Open-source library; self-hosted. No per-MAU fees. | Your infra | OAuth providers, sessions, adapters | Familiar in Next.js ecosystem; community-driven | Next.js apps that prefer OSS + DIY control |
| Auth0 | SaaS (per MAU tiers, free dev plan available) | Auth0 cloud | Enterprise SSO, MFA, actions/hooks, orgs, B2B/B2C | Hosted UI + APIs; rich admin console | Enterprise needs, compliance, low-ops SaaS |
| Clerk | SaaS (free MAU tier; pay-as-you-grow) | Clerk cloud | Prebuilt UIs, MFA, passkeys, orgs, webhooks | Very strong DX; polished hosted widgets | Move fast with managed auth + modern UX |
| Supabase Auth | Included with Supabase; free tier + usage-based | Supabase cloud (or self-host) | Auth (email/OAuth), DB, storage, functions | Tight Postgres integration; good DX | Full-stack on Supabase, quick prototypes |
| Firebase Auth | Google Cloud; free tier + usage-based | Google cloud | Email/password, phone, OAuth; SDKs | Mobile-first tooling; hosted flows | Mobile and Firebase-centric stacks |

## Notes

- SaaS (Auth0, Clerk) typically charge by Monthly Active Users (MAU) with free tiers and pay-as-you-grow; verify current pricing:
  - Auth0: https://auth0.com/pricing
  - Clerk: https://clerk.com/pricing
- OSS libraries (Keyloom, NextAuth.js) have no per-MAU fees but require you to run the infra and own security posture.
- Supabase and Firebase bundle auth with their platforms; costs depend on overall usage and plan.

## Security & compliance

- All solutions support modern security features; SaaS providers often add turnkey enterprise features (e.g., SAML, advanced audits) at higher tiers.
- With self-hosted OSS, you maintain control and can design for your compliance requirements; you must also operate it securely.

## Developer experience

- Keyloom & NextAuth: code-first, flexible, framework-native.
- Clerk: fast to integrate with polished hosted components.
- Auth0: comprehensive admin console and extensibility via actions; more initial setup.
- Supabase/Firebase: tight platform integration and tooling.

## Choosing

- Prefer self-hosted OSS without MAU fees and strong TypeScript DX: Keyloom or NextAuth.
- Prefer fully managed auth with hosted UIs and enterprise features: Auth0 or Clerk.
- Building within a broader platform: Supabase or Firebase may be most convenient.
