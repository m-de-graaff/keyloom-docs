# Common Errors

## 404 on /api/auth routes
- Ensure the file exists at `app/api/auth/[...keyloom]/route.ts`
- Export both `GET` and `POST` from `createNextHandler(config)`

## Redirect loop in middleware
- Re-run `npx keyloom routes --out .keyloom/routes.generated.ts`
- Ensure public paths (e.g., `/sign-in`) are annotated correctly

## Too many login attempts (429)
- Add rate limiting around credential flows; see Concepts â†’ Rate Limiting

## Failed to fetch JWKS
- Set `KEYLOOM_JWT_JWKS_URL` and `KEYLOOM_JWT_ISSUER` when using JWT strategy
- Verify the URL is reachable from the server environment

## Provider invalid callback
- Callback must be `${BASE_URL}/api/auth/callback/<providerId>`
- Update the provider config in the provider dashboard to match
