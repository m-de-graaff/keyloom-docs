# Provider Troubleshooting

## Invalid redirect URI
- Callback must match exactly: `${BASE_URL}/api/auth/callback/<providerId>`
- Update the provider dashboard with the correct URL

## Missing client secret
- Ensure `*_CLIENT_ID` and `*_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars are set and loaded by Next.js

## Consent screen errors (Google)
- Publish the consent screen or add test users while in testing mode

## Organization SSO (Auth0/Microsoft)
- Confirm scopes and tenant configuration match what your app requests
