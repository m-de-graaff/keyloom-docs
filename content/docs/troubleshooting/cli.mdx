# CLI Troubleshooting

## "keyloom: command not found"
- Install it locally and use npx: `npx keyloom <command>`

## routes.generated missing
- Run `npx keyloom routes --out .keyloom/routes.generated.ts`
- Commit the generated file if your CI needs it

## Windows path issues
- Run the CLI from the project root
- Use quoted paths with `--cwd` if your path includes spaces

## Migrations not applied
- For Prisma: run `npx prisma migrate dev` after `npx keyloom generate migration`
