Troubleshoot Prisma and adapter-related issues.

<Steps>

### 1) PrismaClient

Instantiate once and reuse. Avoid creating a new client per request in serverless environments.

### 2) Schema and migrations

Ensure required tables exist and have indexes (unique email, session id). Run migrations.

### 3) Connection URL

Verify `DATABASE_URL` and SSL options for your provider (e.g., RDS, Neon, PlanetScale).

### 4) Transactions

If you see partial writes, check database isolation and long-running hooks that may block or retry.

</Steps>

<Callout>
Use `PrismaAdapter(new PrismaClient())` and pass the live client, not a factory. Regenerate Prisma types after schema changes.
