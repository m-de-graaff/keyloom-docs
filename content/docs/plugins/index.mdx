Plugins extend Keyloom with reusable capabilities: authentication factors (e.g., passkeys), auditing, custom policies, rate limiting, or enterprise integrations.

## How it works

A plugin typically exposes a setup function you pass into `plugins` in your Keyloom config. The plugin can register server hooks, options, and (optionally) client helpers.

<Steps>

### 1) Install and import

Install the plugin package (name varies per plugin), then import its setup function.

```ts
import { somePlugin } from 'keyloom-plugin-example'
import base from '@/keyloom.config'

export default {
  ...base,
  plugins: [somePlugin({ /* options */ })],
}
```

### 2) Configure options

Plugins should be explicit and stateless; pass options (e.g., timeouts, feature toggles) through the setup function. Keep secrets in environment variables.

### 3) Use provided APIs

Some plugins expose server helpers, endpoints (mounted via the shared API handler), or client utilities/components you can render in your app.

</Steps>

## Best practices

- Keep plugin boundaries clear; avoid global mutation
- Provide sensible defaults; document each option
- Surface precise TypeScript types for excellent DX
- Log important events for observability and support

## Troubleshooting

- Verify the plugin is included in `plugins` in your Keyloom config
- Confirm environment variables are present at runtime
- If endpoints are missing, check the shared API handler wiring
