Keyloom integrates cleanly with modern JavaScript stacks. This section explains how to wire Keyloom into frameworks and platforms, focusing on Next.js first.

- Shared API handler powers all auth endpoints
- Middleware for route protection and session cookies
- UI components for common flows (sign-in, sign-up, reset password, 2FA)
- Providers (OAuth) and plugins extend functionality

## What to expect

<Steps>

### 1) Framework-specific setup

Each integration covers handler wiring, environment variables, and recommended routing patterns.

### 2) Route protection patterns

Decide between middleware-based protection and server helpers (e.g., guard) for authenticated pages and APIs.

### 3) Client vs Server usage

Understand which components must run on the client (`"use client"`) and how to access sessions on the server.

### 4) Troubleshooting

Integration pages include common pitfalls, such as cookie domains, CSRF, and callback URLs.

</Steps>
