# Adapters

Keyloom persists users, sessions, OAuth accounts, and (optionally) RBAC state through a database adapter.

Currently supported (official):

- **Prisma** - Full-featured ORM with excellent TypeScript support
- **Drizzle** - Lightweight ORM with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite support
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database with flexible schema
- **PostgreSQL** - Direct PostgreSQL access with node-postgres driver
- **MySQL** - MySQL and MariaDB support with mysql2 driver

## Usage

```ts
import { defineKeyloom } from "@keyloom/core";
import { prismaAdapter } from "@keyloom/adapters";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export default defineKeyloom({
  adapter: prismaAdapter(prisma),
  baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL!,
  session: { strategy: "database" },
});
```

<Callout>
  Choose the adapter that best fits your database setup and requirements.
