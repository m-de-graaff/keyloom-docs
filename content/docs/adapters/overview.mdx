# Adapters

Adapters implement a small contract to persist users, sessions, verification tokens, and OAuth accounts. Use a built-in adapter or create your own.

## Use Prisma Adapter

```ts
import { PrismaAdapter } from "@keyloom/adapters";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const db = new PrismaClient();
const adapter = PrismaAdapter(db);
```

Pass `adapter` into your `keyloom.config.ts` or server builder.

## Adapter Interface

See the Core overview for the full `Adapter` TypeScript interface. Any production adapter must implement:

- Users: create/get/update; unique email
- Accounts: link/get by provider
- Sessions: create/get/delete
- Tokens: create/use verification tokens (single-use, hashed at rest)
- Audit: append audit events

## Testing & Contracts

The repo includes adapter contract tests under `packages/adapters/_contracts`. Use these to validate your custom adapter against the expected behavior (sessions, RBAC, refresh store, etc.).

## Advanced: Other Adapters

Available packages:
- `@keyloom/adapters/prisma`
- `@keyloom/adapters/drizzle`
- `@keyloom/adapters/postgres`
- `@keyloom/adapters/mysql2`
- `@keyloom/adapters/mongo`

Each package exposes a factory similar to `PrismaAdapter(...)`. Consult package READMEs or upcoming per-adapter pages.

## Memory Adapter (Dev/Test)

```ts
import { memoryAdapter } from "@keyloom/core";
const adapter = memoryAdapter();
```

Useful for local prototyping and unit tests. Not for production.
