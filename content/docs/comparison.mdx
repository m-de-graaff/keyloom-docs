  session: Session | null, 
  user: User | null 
} = await getCurrentSession(cookieValue, adapter);
```

Use only what you need with tree-shaking support:

```typescript
// Import only specific functions
import { login } from "@keyloom/core/runtime/login";
import { validateDoubleSubmit } from "@keyloom/core/guard/csrf";
import { tokenHash } from "@keyloom/core/crypto/token-hash";
```
