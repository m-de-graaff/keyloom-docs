## Migration Process Overview

All migration guides follow a similar process:

### 1. **Preparation Phase**
- Export user data from current solution
- Document authentication flows and providers
- Set up staging environment for testing
- Plan downtime and rollback strategies

### 2. **Setup Phase**
- Install and configure Keyloom
- Set up equivalent OAuth providers
- Configure database adapters and run migrations
- Implement authentication endpoints

### 3. **Data Migration Phase**
- Transform user data to Keyloom format
- Import users, accounts, and sessions
- Handle password migration strategies
- Preserve custom claims and metadata

### 4. **Code Migration Phase**
- Replace authentication SDK calls
- Update client-side authentication logic
- Migrate server-side authentication checks
- Convert authorization rules and policies

### 5. **Testing Phase**
- Test all authentication flows
- Verify user data integrity
- Test authorization and permissions
- Performance and security testing

### 6. **Deployment Phase**
- Deploy to production environment
- Monitor authentication metrics
- Handle any migration issues
- Decommission old authentication system

## Common Migration Challenges

### Password Hash Incompatibility

Most authentication providers use proprietary password hashing that cannot be directly imported:

**Solutions:**
- **Password Reset**: Force all users to reset passwords (recommended)
- **Gradual Migration**: Fallback to old system until user logs in
- **Magic Links**: Temporarily use passwordless authentication

### OAuth Token Migration

OAuth access tokens cannot be transferred between systems:

**Solutions:**
- Users need to re-authenticate with OAuth providers
- Implement seamless re-authentication flow
- Preserve user preferences and settings

### Custom Claims and Metadata

Each system has different ways of storing user metadata:

**Solutions:**
- Map custom claims to Keyloom's metadata system
- Use migration scripts to transform data formats
- Implement hooks to preserve business logic

### Authorization Rules

Different systems handle authorization differently:

**Solutions:**
- Convert database-level rules to application logic
- Implement middleware for authorization checks
- Use Keyloom's built-in RBAC system
